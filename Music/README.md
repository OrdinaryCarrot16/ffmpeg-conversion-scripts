I have added some filters to attempt to enhance the songs.

Enhancements may include manual normalization, and blank space trimming.


Music Download Site Priority:

     1. Bandcamp
     2. Qobuz
     3. Steam (mostly game sound-tracks)
     4. Amazon Music (no lossless downloads as far as I can see)
     5. (Other) (such as a direct download link)
     6. YouTube Rip (if no download avaliable)
