I have added some filters to attempt to enhance the songs (though its perspective if it actually improves it).

Enhancements may include 'normalization', and 'trimming (to make the beginning and end times of songs consistent (the empty spaces), not the actual audio)'.

Use ' / ' (spaces included, no single quotes) when specifying multiple artists, and ' | ' (spaces included, no single quotes) when specifying multiple genres.
