The '[Filtered]' on the file name means I have added some filters to attempt to enhance the song (though its based on perspective it actually improves it).
I have also made unfiltered versions for those who want, well, an unfiltered song.

Enhancements may include 'normalization', and 'trimming (to make the beginning and end times of songs consistent (the empty spaces), not the actual audio)'.
