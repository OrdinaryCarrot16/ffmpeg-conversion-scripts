Video Ripping/Download Priority:

    1. Blu-Ray (Movies, Mini Series)
    2. DVD (Series) (Due to tons of series being avaliable on DVD, as well as smaller file sizes; they would probably get huge if they were blu-ray sized full series)
    3. YouTube (Free Web Series/Movies)
    4. Streaming/Buying Services (Series/Movies not avaliable on disc) (Will probably never have scripts for them. For movies/series unavaliable to buy on disc, I'll just have to purchase/stream them on sites such as VUDU, Amazon, and YouTube)

Note: Run the .ps1 scripts, not the .avs scripts.
