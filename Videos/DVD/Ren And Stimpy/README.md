## MakeMKV Version
Should work perfectly fine with version 1.17.5 of MakeMKV (the version I used for the scripts), but due to the software still being in beta, I can't guarrantee compatibility with later versions. And I can't change all my conversion scripts everytime an update breaks the timings I had (if that even happens, but I'm feeling paranoid about it)... I'm only one person. Maybe once MakeMKV enters stable, I won't have to worry about that.

But for the time being and the potential future, enjoy the scripts.
