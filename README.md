# FFmpeg Conversion Scripts
A collection of handmade batch scripts that will automatically encode music and videos, using FFmpeg (and others when needed).


## **TO DO:**

- ~~Make this repo.~~
- Make more scripts.
- Clean up scripting code, and optimze it more.
- Make scripts cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Make a script that allows user to call FFmpeg from any directory (need to modify PATH).
