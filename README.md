# FFmpeg Conversion Scripts
A collection of handmade & generated powershell/batch scripts that will automatically encode music and videos, using the awesome FFmpeg.

# At the moment, I'm mainly working on getting this to work with Kodi. There seems to be inconsistincies between different media software, so it would be a pleasant surprise if most things work seamlessly (with Emby/Plex & the like).
